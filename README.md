Learning Python, game engines, and roguelike's through the Python TCOD tutorial

This was a Python Roguelike Game made with Python following this tutorial: http://rogueliketutorials.com/ <br><br>
I do not take any credit for any of the code. This was simply me learning about game dev, python, the tcod library, and programming. It probably took me closer to forty hours to complete the tutorial.<br><br>
In the future I would love to revisit this project, starting with creating a unique tileset for it!
